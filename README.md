## vthang's README
Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Tran Viet Thang. Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Engineering Manager at AGBiz, based in Ha Noi, Viet Nam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³.

My daily work includes exploring new technologies, building proofs of concept, mentoring team members, and managing people across all areas of the companyâ€™s development.
This page explains the best ways to work with me.

## My philosophy

I value trust, transparency, openness, and honesty. Iâ€™ll give you the same in return.

I welcome diverse ideas and perspectives. Not every idea has to be perfect; itâ€™s better to share and discuss than to keep quiet.

I care about creating an environment where people can work happily and grow both towards their own goals and the companyâ€™s.

## I value your privacy

Personal topics (and PII) belong in DMs. For everything else, please tag me in channels so others can benefit from the discussion too.

## Working together

I wonâ€™t know your issues unless you tell me, so reaching out is always welcome. Please let me know why you need my attention do you want me to act, decide, or just be aware?

When reaching out, [nohello](https://nohello.net/en/) please.

I read, care about, and appreciate all feedback.

Iâ€™m also happy to meet 1-on-1 in person!

## My style

I focus on supporting and empowering my team, building trust, and sparking conversations. If you ever need backup, Iâ€™ve got you covered.

I enjoy talking about both technology and business, and I love diving into technical discussions. Iâ€™m always open to learning from you and happy to share what I know. If I ever push things too far, just let me know.
